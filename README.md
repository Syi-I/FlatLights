# FlatLights

### This mod just adds some new blocks meant to be used as neon lights for builds.

- The flat blocks are textureless and borderless. Also gives off light with the same level as glowstone.
- Variant blocks are *supposed* to have tileable textures (*if they aren't blame my awesome MS paint skills*). 
- Variant blocks have a lower light level compared to the regular flat blocks.
- All blocks are harvestable by hand and can be mined quickly.
- Works with shaders and looks kinda neat (*add them as emissive blocks if that's an option somewhere for your shader of choice, that's what makes the blocks glow in the dark. I use tweaked versions of either BSL or Complementary depending on how I'm feeling*).
- The crafting recipes are really easy and generous because I'm lazy and don't want to gather materials.

## Available Colors of FlatLight Blocks

There are 16 available colors for Flat Light Blocks, corresponding to the dye colors in-game. The screenshots below demonstrate the light emission with and without shaders. Each square cell is a 2x2 of the Flat Lights, showing that there is no distinguishable border that appears when using the blocks. *Shaders used are a tweaked version of BSL via the Oculus mod*.

## Variants of FlatLight Blocks

These are all the available blocks from FlatLights. Variants include hex blocks, large hex blocks, tiles, and large tiles. Each variant is tileable, as demonstrated by the 2x2 squares of each block type. *Shaders used are a tweaked version of Complementary Shaders via the Oculus mod*.
