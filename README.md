# FlatLights

### This mod just adds some new blocks meant to be used as neon lights for builds.

- The blocks are textureless and borderless.
- Gives off light with the same level as glowstone.
- Works with shaders and looks kinda neat.
- The crafting recipe is really easy and generous because I'm lazy and don't want to gather materials.

## All the available colors of Flat Lights

There are 16 available colors for Flat Light Blocks, corresponding to the dye colors in-game. The screenshots below demonstrate the light emission with and without shaders. Each square cell is a 2x2 of the Flat Lights, showing that there is no distinguishable border that appears when using the blocks. *Shaders used are BSL via the Oculus mod*.

Yeah it looks like the Lapis Caelestis blocks from Extra Utilities, that's kinda the point. BUT, there's also only so many ways to make a monochrome block with no details so relax. And yeah I know the code is trash, I made this in a couple hours starting from knowing literally nothing about writing mods, and it definitely shows in the code. I followed the first tutorial that popped up on Google sue me.
