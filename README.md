Find the mod wiki [here](https://github.com/Syi-I/FlatLights-Wiki/wiki) for more in-depth details.

 

## Description
**Flat Lights** is a mod that adds a variety of decorative lighting blocks as well as some unique tools and enchantments. The blocks have very simple textures and are available in the 16 dye colors of vanilla Minecraft, as well as 16 alternate colors available through crafting. Recipes for these blocks are all very cheap since the main purpose is just decorative lighting blocks, and nobody wants to grind for building materials anyway.

 

## **Feature Summary:**

- Light blocks with high light levels, similar to glowstone
- Partial blocks of different shapes which are directional and waterloggable
- Edge lights that follow along the sides of solid blocks
- Glass blocks (with the same pattern variations as the light blocks)
- Cheap recipes for all blocks, allowing for easy mass production to quickly get into building and decorating
- A handful of interesting and useful tools with lots of functionality
- A variety of enchantments for tools and armor
- Curios that can be looted from generated structures

 

### Colors and Patterns
There are different variations of the blocks with different patterns, as well as plain, flat textured blocks if you are just looking for color and nothing extra.

### Special Block Shapes
Flat Lights also adds some partial blocks that can be used, again available in the 16 dye colors and the 16 alternate colors. These blocks are able to be waterlogged and directionally placed as well, perhaps useful for interior lighting or making neon signs.

### Shaders Demo
The lights can also look nice with shaders applied. (_Complementary Shaders used in this image via Oculus, tweaked such that the blocks have emissive properties similar to the Redstone lamp blocks_)

### Extra Items
Aside from that there are a some extra items and blocks in the mod not related to building, mostly for fun and utility. Those aren't too important though, the main focus is decorative lights.
