This mod just adds some new blocks meant to be used as neon lights for builds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The blocks are textureless and borderless, and give off light with a similar level to glowstone.
Works with shaders and looks kinda neat.
The crafting recipe is really easy and generous because I'm lazy and don't want to gather materials.

yeah it looks like lapis caelestis from exu that's kinda the point, but there's only so many ways to make a monochrome block with no details too so relax. and yeah I know the code is trash I made this in a couple hours starting from knowing literally nothing about writing mods, and it definitely shows in the code.
